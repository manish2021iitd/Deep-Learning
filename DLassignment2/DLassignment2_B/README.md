Fine-tuning Pretrained Models with Weight and Biases (WandB)
This repository contains code for fine-tuning pretrained models using PyTorch, with integration of Weight and Biases for experiment tracking.
In deep learning, fine-tuning pretrained models is a common technique to leverage existing knowledge from models trained on large datasets. This repository demonstrates how to fine-tune a ResNet50 model on a custom dataset using PyTorch. Additionally, it integrates WandB for experiment tracking and hyperparameter tuning.
